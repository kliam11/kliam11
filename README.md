## About Me

I'm Liam and I am a sophomore Computer Science student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy hiking, baking treats for my dogs, 
and am a huge hsitory buff. I am interested in learning as much as possible about the different roles in software development.

I am most proficient in Python (matpltolib, pandas, numpy), Java and C, but I still have much to learn! 
In school, I am currently learning software engineering practices, basic web development and algorithms. 
On my own time, I am learning a smattering of data analysis, API development and building things with the Raspberry Pi.
