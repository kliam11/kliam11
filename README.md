Howdy! 

I'm Liam and I am a sophomore Computer Science student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy hiking, baking treats for my dogs, 
and am a huge hsitory buff. 

I have long been interested in the space and defence sector, and most of my projects will have some relevance to that. 
I am most proficient in Python (matpltolib, pandas, numpy), Java and C, but I still have much to learn! 
In school, I am currently learning software engineering practices, basic web development and algorithms. 

If you would like to see my LinkedIn page: www.linkedin.com/in/liamakelly 

Otherwise, have a look at some of my code and let me know what you think!
