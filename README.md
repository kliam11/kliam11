## Howdy! 🤠 

I'm Liam and I am a sophomore **Computer Science student at Carleton University** in Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy hiking, baking treats for my dogs, 
and am a huge hsitory buff. 

I have long been interested in the **space and defence sector** 🚀, and most of my projects will have some relevance to that. 
I am most proficient in Python (matpltolib, pandas, numpy), Java and C, but I still have much to learn! 
In school, I am currently **learning software engineering practices, basic web development and algorithms**. 
On my own time, I am learning some **data analysis, API development and building things with the Raspberry Pi**. 

Have a look at some of my code and let me know what you think! 

## Projects 

Here are some of my projects that I have built or am building: 

[Earth Satellite Tracker](https://github.com/kliam11/satellite-tracker) (*IN PROGRESS*)

[Library System Simulator](https://github.com/kliam11/library-sim)
