## Howdy! 🤠 

I'm Liam and I am a sophomore **Computer Science student at Carleton University** in Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy hiking, baking treats for my dogs, 
and am a huge hsitory buff. 

I have long been interested in the **space and defence sector** 🚀, and most of my projects will have some relevance to that. 
I am most proficient in Python (matpltolib, pandas, numpy), Java and C, but I still have much to learn! 
In school, I am **currently learning software engineering practices, basic web development and algorithms**.

Otherwise, be sure to have a look at some of my code and let me know what you think!
