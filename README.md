## About Me 🤠

I'm Liam and I am a sophomore Computer Science student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy hiking , baking treats for my dogs, and am a huge hsitory buff.

I am most proficient in **Python** for basic data **analysis** and manipulation (matpltolib, pandas, numpy, SciPy), **Java** and **C**. I am well-versed in the **OOP and MVC patterns**, applying them to many personal and academic projects. I am familar with the **Agile methodology** from extracurriculars, and have a knack for rapid prototyping and **unit testing** solutions to problems. I also actually enjoy writing **good documentation** and have experience with engineering design process. 

In school, I have learned plenty about **algorithms and data structures**, designing BSTs and applying **complexity analysis** for building optimal search methods. Something I'd like to learn in the future is embedded systems. Compilers also sounds interesting... and challenging!
