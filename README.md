## About Me

I'm Liam and I am a sophomore Computer Science student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy hiking, baking treats for my dogs, 
and am a huge hsitory buff. 

I ahve long been interested in the space and defense industry, and some of my projects will have relevance to that. However, I am open to 
all opportunities to learn. 

I am most proficient in Python (matpltolib, pandas, numpy), Java and C, but I still have much to learn! 
In school, I am currently learning software engineering practices, basic web development and algorithms. 
On my own time, I am learning a smattering of data analysis, API development and building things with the Raspberry Pi. 

## Projects 

Here are some of my projects that I have built or am building: 

[Earth Satellite Tracker](https://github.com/kliam11/satellite-tracker) (*IN PROGRESS*)
